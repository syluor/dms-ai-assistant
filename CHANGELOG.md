# Changelog

All notable changes to the AI Assistant plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Inception** / Mercury 2: [API parameters](https://docs.inceptionlabs.ai/get-started/api-parameters) in settings (`reasoning_effort`, `reasoning_summary`, `reasoning_summary_wait`). Temperature clamped 0.5–1.0 per docs
- **Ollama provider** with default local endpoint, installed-model discovery, and a model switcher in the main chat header
- **Gemini Google Search grounding** toggle in settings for web-grounded responses
- **Custom system prompt** per provider in settings, sent via each provider's native format (`system` role message, Anthropic `system` field, or Gemini `systemInstruction`); empty prompts are omitted

### Fixed

- Gemini streaming responses no longer finalize early when search-grounded streaming emits usage metadata before visible text

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed

- Replaced custom markdown parser with [marked.js v1.2.9](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) (MIT License), inlined as a self-contained UMD bundle with a Qt Rich Text-compatible custom renderer
- Proper handling of all standard GFM constructs: nested lists, loose list items, setext headings, link definitions, strikethrough, task lists, and more

### Fixed

- Code blocks and blockquotes inside ordered list items no longer cause numbering to reset; code block tables are hoisted outside `<li>` elements using `<ol start="N">` segments to avoid Qt list-item indentation
- Code block content indentation from being inside a list item is now correctly stripped by marked's built-in fence indentation compensation

## [1.3.3] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- Ordered list numbering no longer resets to 1 when a code block, table, or blockquote appears between list items; uses `<ol start="N">` segments to preserve numbering
- Blockquotes inside ordered list items now render correctly instead of appearing as literal `&gt;` text
- Code blocks inside list items no longer display with the list's indentation; common leading whitespace is stripped before rendering
- Chat view now automatically scrolls to the bottom when a response finishes streaming and markdown is rendered

## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- Robust markdown placeholder system to prevent rendering issues with inline code and other elements
- Inline code styling refined to use CSS padding instead of non-breaking spaces
- Improved restoration logic for protected markdown blocks to ensure perfect HTML output

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- Copy button for code blocks to easily copy snippets to clipboard (fixes #5)
- Visual feedback hint ("Copied to clipboard") when copying text or code

### Fixed

- Code block layout issues including extra spacing, horizontal overflow, and background gaps
- Settings panel sizing issues by providing implicit dimensions (fixes #3)
- Bug where long code lines could break the message bubble structure

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- Per-provider settings profiles via new `providers` persisted object, so switching providers loads each provider's own endpoint/model/token settings
- New chat confirmation dialog when history exists
- Privacy note based on the AI service provider (remote vs. local)
- Temporary hint system for better user feedback
- Message regeneration for specific assistant messages
- Redesigned composer with improved layout and icon buttons

### Changed

- Provider switch in settings now immediately swaps to that provider's saved profile instead of reusing the previous provider's configuration
- Composer layout optimized for better space usage and readability

### Fixed

- Requests using stale custom endpoint/model settings after switching provider from the dropdown
- Chat history being cleared when switching providers (history is now retained per provider configuration)
- Gemini requests failing with HTTP 400 due to unsupported `stream` field in request body
- Gemini responses rendering empty in UI by enabling SSE mode and handling array-shaped streamed/final payloads

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Enter key now sends messages (Shift+Enter inserts newline) - issue #6
- Regenerate button on assistant messages (appears on hover) - issue #6

### Changed

- Send/Stop buttons are now icon-only (40x40) with tooltips - issue #6
- Improved Gemini streaming finalization to handle `usageMetadata` end-of-stream signal

## [1.1.3] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- Settings dropdown becoming non-interactive after toggling the plugin off/on from DMS settings while the settings panel was open

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- Provider dropdown in the settings panel becoming non-interactive after closing and reopening the panel without restarting DMS

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- Streaming responses appearing empty due to `curl --compressed` interfering with `StdioCollector` stdout capture

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-17

### Added

- Table rendering support in markdown with borders and proper cell alignment
- Task list rendering with checkbox symbols (☑ for checked, ☐ for unchecked)
- Strikethrough text support (`~~text~~` syntax)
- Code block language labels (displays language identifier above code blocks)

### Fixed

- Header spacing issues - now use CSS margins for consistent spacing
- Code block background gaps with proper margin application
- Settings panel sliders showing duplicate values on hover (e.g., "51205120" instead of "5120")
- Regex backreferences in HTML cleanup causing headers to not render properly
- Inconsistent spacing between markdown elements throughout rendered content
- Code block language labels now use padding instead of margin to eliminate gaps

### Changed

- Slider values now display in setting labels instead of tooltips for always-visible feedback
- Updated markdown2html.js header comment to accurately describe supported features

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added

- Initial release of AI Assistant plugin
- Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Custom)
- Streaming response support with real-time rendering
- Markdown rendering with headers, bold, italic, code blocks, links, blockquotes
- Persistent chat history across sessions

- Configurable model parameters (temperature, max tokens)
- Monospace font toggle for technical discussions
- Message retry functionality
- Copy last assistant response to clipboard
- Chat history clearing
- Comprehensive settings panel with live updates

### Fixed

- Settings persistence bug where configuration wouldn't load after restart
